    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze historical movie data to generate actionable insights for a new movie studio venture. Specifically, the analysis aims to identify the key factors that contribute to the commercial success of movies, focusing on profitability, audience reception, and production efficiency. This will help the studio make data-driven decisions regarding budget allocation, genre selection, and release strategies to maximize return on investment (ROI) and minimize financial risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Business Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which genres and types of movies yield the highest ROI and profitability?**\n",
    "- **How does production budget correlate with movie revenue and audience ratings?**\n",
    "- **Which studios and production companies have a consistent track record of success?**\n",
    "- **What factors (e.g., runtime, release year, genre) influence a movieâ€™s box office performance?**\n"

    "## Combined Issues and Cleaning Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Consistency**\n",
    "- Titles across datasets may differ, which requires careful handling of titles or IDs when merging datasets to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Formatting**\n",
    "- Several columns related to revenue and budget (e.g., `domestic_gross`, `worldwide_gross`, `production_budget`, etc.) are stored as strings with special characters (e.g., commas), so these need to be cleaned and converted to numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Missing Data**\n",
    "- Sparse columns (e.g., `foreign_gross`, `studio`, `currency`) will need to be addressed using imputation or exclusion depending on their relevance to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Deduplication**\n",
    "- Ensure that there are no duplicate entries after merging datasets. Identifying duplicates based on movie title or ID is crucial for maintaining data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Alignment**\n",
    "- Date formats, genre categories, and identifiers (like movie IDs) need to be standardized across datasets to ensure consistent analysis.\n",
