## **Project Overview**

In my **Movie Analysis** project, I set out to address pivotal questions about the movie industry, such as:  
- Which genres consistently generate the highest revenue?  
- How do budgets correlate with worldwide gross?  
- What are the most profitable release windows for movies?  
- How do audience ratings influence box office success?  
- Can I use movie attributes to predict revenue?  

My goal was to empower stakeholders in the movie industry to make data-driven decisions by uncovering actionable insights.

# **Data Understanding**

To uncover trends and patterns in the movie industry, I analyzed multiple datasets from various sources. Below, I outline the key datasets I worked with, their features, and the challenges I resolved during my analysis:

---

## 1. **Box Office Mojo Data**

**Overview**: This dataset provided information on box office revenue and studio details.  

- **Shape**: 3,387 rows and 5 columns.

### Columns:
- **title**: Movie title (non-null).  
- **studio**: Studio responsible for the movie (5 missing values).  
- **domestic_gross**: Domestic gross earnings (28 missing values).  
- **foreign_gross**: Foreign gross earnings (1,350 missing values, stored as strings).  
- **year**: Release year (non-null).  

### Actions I Took:
- Converted `foreign_gross` from strings to numeric format to enable accurate calculations.  
- Resolved missing values in the `studio` and revenue columns using context-driven techniques.

## 2. **The Numbers Data**

**Overview**: This dataset focused on production budgets, domestic, and worldwide gross revenues.  

- **Shape**: 5,782 rows and 6 columns.

### Columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each movie (non-null).  
- **release_date**: Movie release date (non-null).  
- **movie**: Movie title (non-null).  
- **production_budget**: Production budget (stored as strings with commas, required conversion).  
- **domestic_gross** and **worldwide_gross**: Revenue columns stored as strings with commas.  

### Actions I Took:
- Cleaned and converted all budget and revenue columns into numeric format for easier analysis.  
- Preprocessed string data to ensure consistency, even though there were no missing values.

## 3. **Rotten Tomatoes Reviews Data**

**Overview**: This dataset included reviews, ratings, and publisher information for movies.  

- **Shape**: 54,432 rows and 8 columns.

### Columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for movies (non-null).  
- **review**: Textual review (5,563 missing values).  
- **rating**: Rating given by critics (13,517 missing values).  
- **fresh**: Binary indicator of whether a review is "fresh" or "rotten" (non-null).  
- **critic**: Name of the critic (2,722 missing values).  
- **top_critic**: Flag indicating whether the reviewer is a top critic (non-null).  
- **publisher**: Publisher of the review (309 missing values).  
- **date**: Date of the review (non-null).  

### Actions I Took:
- Analyzed missing data in the `review`, `rating`, and `critic` columns to decide their impact on analysis.  
- Focused on columns that directly contributed to answering project goals, deprioritizing less relevant ones.

## 4. **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info Data**

**Overview**: This dataset provided metadata such as genres, directors, runtime, and box office data.  

- **Shape**: 1,560 rows and 12 columns.

### Columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier (non-null).  
- **synopsis**: Movie synopsis (62 missing values).  
- **rating**: MPAA rating (3 missing values).  
- **genre**: Movie genre (8 missing values).  
- **director**: Director name (199 missing values).  
- **writer**: Writer name (449 missing values).  
- **theater_date**: Theater release date (359 missing values).  
- **dvd_date**: DVD release date (359 missing values).  
- **currency** and **box_office**: Sparse columns with very limited non-null values.  
- **runtime**: Runtime of the movie (30 missing values).  
- **studio**: Studio responsible (very sparse).  

### Actions I Took:
- Noted and accounted for the sparse data in `studio`, `currency`, and `box_office`, which limited their use.  
- Focused on `rating`, `genre`, `director`, and `runtime` for genre-based and attribute-specific analysis.

## 5. **TMDB Data**

**Overview**: This dataset covered popularity metrics, genre information, vote averages, and counts.  

- **Shape**: 26,517 rows and 10 columns.

### Columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier (non-null).  
- **genre_ids**: List of genre IDs for each movie (non-null).  
- **original_language**: Language of the movie (non-null).  
- **original_title** and **title**: Original and common titles (non-null).  
- **popularity**: Popularity score (non-null).  
- **release_date**: Movie release date (non-null).  
- **vote_average** and **vote_count**: Average audience rating and number of votes (non-null).  

### Actions I Took:
- Decoded `genre_ids` into human-readable genres to improve interpretability.

## **Dataframes for Analysis**

After reviewing the datasets, I prioritized the following for analysis:

1. **Box Office Mojo Data**: Analyzed box office trends, domestic vs. international performance, and studio impact.  
2. **The Numbers Data**: Investigated the relationship between budgets and revenues.  
3. **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info Data**: Explored genres, directors, and runtime as factors influencing box office success.  
4. **TheMovieDB Data**: Analyzed audience popularity, vote averages, and their relationship to revenue.
