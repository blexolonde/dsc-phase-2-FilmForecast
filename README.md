## **Project Overview**

In my **Movie Analysis** project, I set out to address pivotal questions about the movie industry, such as:  
- Which genres consistently generate the highest revenue?  
- How do budgets correlate with worldwide gross?  
- What are the most profitable release windows for movies?  
- How do audience ratings influence box office success?  
- Which studios have the highest profit margins?  
- Does the original language of a movie influence its global performance?  
- Can I use movie attributes to predict revenue?  

My goal was to empower stakeholders in the movie industry to make data-driven decisions by uncovering actionable insights.

## **Data Understanding**

To uncover trends and patterns in the movie industry, I analyzed multiple datasets from various sources. Below, I outline the key datasets I worked with, their features, and the challenges I resolved during my analysis:

---

### **Datasets**
1. **Box Office Mojo Data**: Box office performance by studio.  
2. **The Numbers Data**: Focused on budgets and revenues.  
3. **Rotten Tomatoes Reviews Data**: Audience and critic review scores.  
4. **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info Data**: Metadata, including genres, runtime, and release dates.  
5. **TMDB Data**: Popularity metrics, genre insights, and vote data.

**Actions Taken**:  
- Standardized and cleaned all datasets to handle missing values and inconsistent data formatting.  
- Merged relevant datasets to create a consolidated dataset for analysis.

## **Dataframes for Analysis**

The following datasets were prioritized to answer specific questions:  
- **Box Office Mojo**: Studio performance and revenue trends.  
- **The Numbers**: Budget and revenue correlations.  
- **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info**: Genre, director, and runtime analysis.  
- **TMDB**: Popularity, ratings, and language performance trends.

## **Key Features and Insights**

### Questions Addressed:
1. **What genres should producers invest in?**  
   - Action and adventure movies consistently dominate the box office.  
2. **Does budget guarantee success?**  
   - While higher budgets correlate with revenue, profitability relies on strategic allocation.  
3. **Which studios have the highest profit margins?**  
   - Top studios like Disney and Universal outperform others consistently, with significant variability.  
4. **When should movies be released?**  
   - Summer and holiday seasons are optimal for maximizing revenue.  
5. **How do audience ratings affect success?**  
   - Higher ratings and vote counts strongly correlate with better box office performance.  
6. **How does a movie's original language influence revenue?**  
   - Movies in English generate the highest worldwide gross, but non-English films are gaining traction.  
7. **How can we predict movie revenue?**  
   - Using production budgets, genres, release months, and audience ratings, predictive models provide actionable forecasts.
