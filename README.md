## **Project Overview**
In my **Movie Analysis** project, I aimed to uncover pivotal insights into the movie industry by addressing key questions, including:

- Which genres consistently generate the highest revenue?
- How do budgets correlate with worldwide gross?
- What are the most profitable release windows for movies?
- How do audience ratings influence box office success?
- Which studios have the highest profit margins?
- Does the original language of a movie influence its global performance?

My objective was to provide stakeholders with actionable, data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions in movie production and distribution.

## **Data Understanding**
To answer these questions, I analyzed multiple datasets, merging and cleaning them to create a unified dataset for analysis. The primary datasets I used were:

### **Datasets**
1. **Box Office Mojo**: Data on box office performance by studio.
2. **The Numbers**: Focused on production budgets and revenues.
3. **Rotten Tomatoes Reviews**: Audience and critic review scores.
4. **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info**: Metadata, including genres, runtimes, and release dates.
5. **TMDB**: Popularity metrics, genre details, and vote counts.
6. **im.db.zip**: A zipped SQLite database containing `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` tables for detailed insights into movie ratings and metadata.

### **Actions Taken**
- Cleaned and standardized datasets to address missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
- Merged relevant datasets to form a consolidated, clean dataset for analysis.

### **Key Features in the Data**
- **Revenue Metrics**: Domestic, foreign, and worldwide gross.
- **Production Metrics**: Budget, profit, and profit margins.
- **Movie Details**: Genres, runtimes, release dates, and languages.
- **Audience Insights**: Average ratings and vote counts.

## **Graphs and Visualizations**
### Key Visualizations Created:
- **Profit Margins by Studio**: Displays the variability in studio profitability.
- **Budget vs. Profit Margin**: Explores the relationship between budgets and profitability.
- **Average Revenue by Genre**: Highlights top-performing genres globally.
- **Revenue by Release Month**: Shows seasonal trends in box office performance.
- **Revenue by Original Language**: Examines the impact of a movieâ€™s language on global appeal.
- **Audience Ratings vs. Revenue**: Investigates how ratings and votes affect box office performance.

## **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and others for statistical and graphical analysis.

## **Interactive Dashboards**
Using Tableau, I created dashboards that allow stakeholders to:
- Explore genre-specific revenue trends.
- Identify optimal release windows.
- Compare studio profitability.
- Understand the impact of audience ratings on revenue.
